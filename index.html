                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I diet regularly to lose weight, stay healthy and maintain. However, while dieting, I must make sure that there is no harm to the body when I go on a diet. I drink a lot of water. I try to drink eight to ten glasses of water. Instead of eating at night, I try to eat something light. I refrain from eating low-fat cooking foods. This is how I control my diet.</p>
